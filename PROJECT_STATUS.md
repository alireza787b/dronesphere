### 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Development (3 terminals)
./scripts/run_sitl.sh      # Terminal 1: SITL
./scripts/start-server.sh  # Terminal 2: Server
./scripts/start-agent.sh   # Terminal 3: Agent

# Validation
./scripts/validate-setup.sh
./scripts/test-mission.sh
```

### 🔧 Development Workflow
```bash
./scripts/format-code.sh     # Format code
./scripts/run-tests.sh       # Run tests
./scripts/check-quality.sh   # Quality checks
```

### 📦 Deployment
- **Agent**: Copy `dronesphere/agent/` to drone hardware
- **Server**: Copy `dronesphere/server/` to coordination hardware
- **Shared**: Copy `dronesphere/{core,commands,backends}/` to both

### 🎯 Next Phase Opportunities
- [ ] Multi-drone fleet coordination
- [ ] Advanced path planning algorithms  
- [ ] Real-time mission monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Hardware-in-the-loop testing
