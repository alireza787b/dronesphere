# Takeoff Command Schema for AI Integration
# Path: mcp/command_schemas/takeoff.yaml

name: takeoff
description: "Launch drone to specified altitude above ground level"

# AI Guidelines for Intelligent Processing
ai_guidelines:
  safety_considerations:
    - "Ensure takeoff altitude is between 1-50 meters for safety"
    - "Check that area above drone is clear of obstacles"
    - "Verify weather conditions are suitable for flight"
    - "Confirm drone is on stable, level ground before takeoff"

  user_education:
    - "Takeoff arms the drone and lifts it vertically to target altitude"
    - "The drone will hover at the specified altitude after takeoff"
    - "Altitude is measured relative to ground level, not sea level"
    - "After takeoff, drone is ready for navigation commands"

  beginner_explanation:
    - "Think of takeoff like an elevator going up to a specific floor"
    - "The drone will rise straight up and stop at your chosen height"
    - "Higher altitude = better view but follows aviation rules"
    - "Start with 10-15 meters for safety and good visibility"

  common_requests:
    - "take off to X meters"
    - "launch drone to X altitude"
    - "lift off X meters high"
    - "go up X meters"

# Parameter Definition
parameters:
  altitude:
    type: float
    required: true
    min_value: 1.0
    max_value: 50.0
    default: 10.0
    unit: "meters"
    description: "Target altitude above current ground level"

    validation:
      recommended_min: 5.0    # For stable flight
      recommended_max: 30.0   # For visual line of sight
      legal_max: 120.0        # But we limit to 50m for safety

    user_guidance:
      beginner: "Start with 10-15 meters for practice"
      expert: "Consider wind conditions at higher altitudes"
      safety_note: "Higher altitude = longer fall time if emergency"

# Safety and Robustness Rules
robustness:
  preconditions:
    - "Drone must be on ground (relative altitude < 0.5m)"
    - "Drone can be armed or disarmed (command will arm if needed)"
    - "Flight area must be clear of obstacles"

  failure_modes:
    already_airborne:
      action: "return_success"
      message: "Drone already airborne - takeoff not needed"

    insufficient_battery:
      action: "warn_continue"
      threshold: 20  # percent
      message: "Low battery warning - consider charging before flight"

    bad_weather:
      action: "warn_continue"
      message: "Check weather conditions before takeoff"

# Integration with DroneSphere Universal Protocol
protocol_mapping:
  dronesphere_command: "takeoff"
  parameter_mapping:
    altitude: "altitude"  # Direct mapping

  example_request:
    commands:
      - name: "takeoff"
        params:
          altitude: 15.0
        mode: "continue"
    target_drone: 1
    queue_mode: "override"

# Multi-language Support (AI handles translation)
language_patterns:
  english:
    - "take off to {altitude} meters"
    - "launch drone {altitude}m high"
    - "lift off to {altitude} meters"

  spanish:
    - "despegar a {altitude} metros"
    - "elevar dron {altitude} metros"

  french:
    - "décoller à {altitude} mètres"
    - "élever le drone à {altitude} mètres"

  german:
    - "starten auf {altitude} Meter"
    - "abheben auf {altitude} Meter Höhe"

# Context-Aware Responses
response_templates:
  success:
    beginner: "🚁 Great! Your drone is now flying at {altitude} meters. It's hovering safely and ready for your next command."
    expert: "✅ Takeoff completed to {altitude}m in {duration}s. Drone armed and stabilized."

  safety_warning:
    high_altitude: "⚠️ {altitude}m is quite high! For safety, consider starting lower around 10-15m until you're comfortable."
    low_battery: "🔋 Battery at {battery}% - you might want to charge before extended flight."

  error:
    already_airborne: "ℹ️ Your drone is already flying at {current_altitude}m. No takeoff needed!"
    ground_required: "❌ Takeoff requires drone to be on the ground. Current altitude: {current_altitude}m"

# Educational Content for New Users
education:
  safety_tips:
    - "Always maintain visual line of sight with your drone"
    - "Check local regulations - max altitude varies by location"
    - "Start with lower altitudes to practice control"
    - "Have a landing plan before takeoff"

  physics_explanation:
    - "Drone uses rotors to generate lift force greater than weight"
    - "Altitude is maintained by balancing lift with gravity"
    - "Wind affects stability - higher = more wind"

  legal_considerations:
    - "Most areas limit recreational drones to 120m (400ft)"
    - "Some locations require permits for any flight"
    - "Always check NOTAMs and restricted airspace"
