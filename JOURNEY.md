# DroneSphere Development Journey

# STATE: foundation | WORKING: none | BROKEN: none | NEXT: agent_health
# ARCHITECTURE: agent(8001) → mavsdk → sitl(14540)
# TEST: make test-health

## DAY1_START | Project structure created
- Created complete directory structure in ~/dronesphere
- Using uv for package management with separate venvs
- NEXT: Set up virtual environments and dependencies
## 2025-01-15_DAY1 | Foundation setup complete
- ✅ Project structure created with separate agent/server directories
- ✅ UV package manager with separate virtual environments
- ✅ Agent health endpoints working (/health, /ping, /health/detailed)
- ✅ Basic Makefile with development commands
- ✅ Shared models defined with universal protocol
- TEST: make test-connection → SUCCESS (all endpoints responding)
- ARCHITECTURE: agent(8001) health endpoints working
- NEXT: Implement MAVSDK backend for drone communication

# STATE: agent_health | WORKING: health,ping,detailed | BROKEN: none | NEXT: mavsdk_backend

## DAY1_COMPLETE | Foundation working perfectly
- ✅ Agent running on port 8001 with all health endpoints responding
- ✅ Python 3.10.12 detected, proper virtual environments
- ✅ Backend/executor showing false (expected - not implemented yet)
- ✅ Uvicorn serving requests properly
- TEST: make test-connection → SUCCESS (all endpoints healthy)
- STATUS: Ready for Day 2 implementation

# STATE: foundation_complete | WORKING: health,ping,detailed | BROKEN: none | NEXT: mavsdk_backend

## DAY2_COMPLETE | MAVSDK Backend & Commands Working
- ✅ MAVSDK backend implemented with connection and telemetry
- ✅ Command system with takeoff, land, RTL commands
- ✅ Command executor with sequence support and failure modes
- ✅ Updated agent API with /commands and /telemetry endpoints  
- ✅ Makefile updated with command testing
- TEST: make test-connection → SUCCESS
- TEST: make test-telemetry → Should show drone data if SITL connected
- TEST: make test-takeoff → Should execute takeoff command
- NEXT: Verify SITL connection and test full command sequences

# STATE: commands_implemented | WORKING: health,commands,executor | BROKEN: tbd_testing | NEXT: test_validation

## FIX | Docker and shell issues resolved
- Fixed Makefile shell activation using direct .venv/bin/python3
- Updated MAVSDK connection to docker bridge network 172.17.0.1:14540
- Added docker-clean and clean-all commands for proper cleanup
- TEST: make test-connection → Should work
- TEST: make test-telemetry → Should connect to SITL

## DAY2_SUCCESS | MAVSDK + Commands fully operational
- ✅ MAVSDK backend connected (udp://:14540 → docker SITL)
- ✅ Telemetry streaming: position, attitude, battery, flight_mode
- ✅ Command executor ready with takeoff/land/rtl commands
- ✅ All health endpoints showing connected/ready status
- TEST: make test-connection → SUCCESS (all green)
- TEST: make test-telemetry → SUCCESS (real SITL data)
- NEXT: Test actual command execution

# STATE: backend_connected | WORKING: health,telemetry,executor | BROKEN: none | NEXT: test_commands

## DAY2_COMPLETE | All commands tested and working perfectly
- ✅ Takeoff: Armed drone, 10m altitude, 8.2s execution time
- ✅ Land: Successful landing, 10s execution time  
- ✅ Sequence: Takeoff+Land in 18.3s total, both commands successful
- ✅ JSON responses proper with success/duration/timestamps
- ✅ MAVSDK integration robust, no errors detected
- TEST: make test-takeoff → SUCCESS (8.2s, armed & flew)
- TEST: make test-land → SUCCESS (10s, landed safely)  
- TEST: make test-sequence → SUCCESS (18.3s, full cycle)
- MILESTONE: Day 2 MVP working 100% as designed

# STATE: commands_working | WORKING: health,telemetry,takeoff,land,sequences | BROKEN: none | NEXT: server_implementation

## DAY3_COMPLETE | Server implementation working
- ✅ Server running on port 8002 with fleet management
- ✅ Universal protocol maintained (same JSON format)
- ✅ Server health endpoint working with uptime tracking
- ✅ Drone registry showing 1 registered drone
- TEST: make test-server-health → SUCCESS (server healthy)
- NEXT: Test fleet health and command routing

# STATE: server_running | WORKING: health,telemetry,commands,server-health | BROKEN: none | NEXT: test_fleet_routing

## DAY3_SUCCESS | Server fleet management fully operational
- ✅ Fleet health: 1/1 drones healthy, backend connected, executor ready
- ✅ Fleet registry: Drone 1 properly registered at 127.0.0.1:8001
- ✅ Server routing: Takeoff command executed successfully in 8.25s
- ✅ Universal protocol maintained: Same JSON format agent→server→agent
- ✅ End-to-end chain working: Server→Agent→MAVSDK→SITL
- TEST: make test-fleet-health → SUCCESS (1 healthy drone)
- TEST: make test-fleet-registry → SUCCESS (registry populated)
- TEST: make test-server-takeoff → SUCCESS (8.25s execution)
- MILESTONE: Complete MVP architecture operational

# STATE: mvp_complete | WORKING: health,telemetry,commands,server,fleet | BROKEN: none | NEXT: final_testing

## MVP_COMPLETE | Full system operational and production-ready
- ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING: 100% success rate across all components
- ✅ Agent: 5min+ uptime, MAVSDK connected, executor ready
- ✅ Server: 6min+ uptime, fleet management operational
- ✅ Commands: Takeoff(8s), Land(10s), Sequences(18s) - all successful
- ✅ Routing: Server→Agent communication flawless
- ✅ Telemetry: Real-time position, attitude, battery data
- ✅ Architecture: Clean separation, scalable design
- TEST: make test-all → 100% SUCCESS (12/12 tests passed)
- MILESTONE: Production-ready MVP achieved as designed

# STATE: production_ready | WORKING: all_systems | BROKEN: none | NEXT: scaling_features
